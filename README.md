This is a CRUD application made to replicate the functionality of Reddit.com. It has all the main features of Reddit, including the creation and deletion of accounts, subscriptions, private subreddits/communities, moderator statuses, and comments. This was built primarily on Sinatra and ActiveRecord, with Bootstrap for styling.
